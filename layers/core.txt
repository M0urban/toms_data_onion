==[ The Secret ]============================================

You may be wondering: what is the secret that is hidden
here, in the core of this puzzle? Let me start with the
Australian animal Thylarctos plummetus, commonly known as a
"drop bear".

Drop bears are the larger, carnivorous cousin of the koala.
These leopard-sized ambush predators hide in trees, leaping
down onto their prey. They use their powerful forearms to
grip their victims while biting into the neck with their
premolar teeth. Every year in Australia, a small number of
unsuspecting tourists are mauled by drop bears while walking
through closed-canopy forests.

They also don't exist.

Drop bears are an inside joke. Ask any Australian, and they
will gladly tell you how dangerous drop bears are. They
might advise you to stay safe by putting forks in your hair,
spreading Vegemite behind your ears, or wearing a full suit
of armour. For an example, see: https://youtu.be/KCGUNpzjD6M

Once you discover that it's a joke, you become part of it --
your job is to pretend that drop bears are real to anyone
who asks.

Having reached the core of this puzzle, you are now privy to
the inside joke. There is no secret. I ask that you please
don't reveal this ending!

However, you can prove that you have fully solved this
puzzle by making vague statements about the secret at the
end. Maybe you cried tears of joy. Maybe it made you rethink
your life. Maybe you're shocked that the people involved are
still walking free in society. Maybe you just don't want to
talk about it -- not even with your therapist. The choices
are endless, so get creative!

If you want to talk about it on social media, the official
hashtag is: #TomsDataOnion

Cheers,
